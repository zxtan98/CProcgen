## Game Description
The player controls a small starship and must destroy a much bigger boss starship. The boss randomly selects from a set of possible attacks when engaging the player. The player must dodge the incoming projectiles or be destroyed. The player can also use randomly scattered meteors for cover. After a set timeout, the boss becomes vulnerable and its shields go down. At this point, the player's projectile attacks will damage the boss. Once the boss receives a certain amount of damage, the player receives a reward, and the boss raises its shields again. If the player damages the boss several times in this way, the boss is eventually destroyed, the player receives a large reward, and the episode ends.
