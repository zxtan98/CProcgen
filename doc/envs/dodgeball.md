## Game Description
Loosely inspired by the Atari game "Berzerk," Dodgeball is a game where the player spawns in a room with random configurations of walls and enemies. The objective is to navigate the room without touching the walls, as doing so will result in losing the game and ending the episode. The player moves relatively slowly and can throw balls in the direction they are facing. The enemies also move slowly and will occasionally throw balls at the player. If the player successfully hits all enemies, they can move to the unlocked platform and earn a significant level completion bonus.
