## Game Description
Inspired by the classic game "Frogger", Leaper requires the player to cross several lanes to reach the finish line and earn a reward. The first group of lanes contains cars that must be avoided. The second group of lanes contains logs on a river. The player must hop from log to log to cross the river. If the player falls in the river, the episode ends.
